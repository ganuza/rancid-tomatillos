# RANCID TOMATILLOS


### **ABSTRACT**
This project was assigned as part of Turing School of Software Design module 3 front end.  The purpose of this project was to make an application that could take in movie data from a server and display that data in clickable cards to a user so that they can get more information on the movie. When on the singular movie page the user can navigate back to the home view of all movies and click and get information on different movies.

### **WINS + CHALLENGES**

##### WINS
Collaboration: We helped each other learn and use new technologies to create a successful application!
Productive Struggle: We hit several road-blocks and were able to use resources available to us to solve them (Docs, Mod3 Lessons, YouTube videos, Mentors, and Cohort mates)
##### CHALLENGES 
Unfamiliar technologies: React, React Router, and Cypress. We came into this project with limited experience in these techs and did a lot of learning as we went.
Refactoring: After implementing React Router we had many issues that had to be adjusted. Our error handling, our Cypress tests, and working on the asynchronous timing of our components using states.
